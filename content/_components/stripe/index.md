System. It focuses among other things on providing the technical, fraud prevention,
and banking infrastructure required to operate on-line payment systems.

## Actions

## Stripe integration connector

This is an open source component to work with Stripe in your integration flows
and it was developed specifically to run on {{site.data.tenant.name}} platform

This is the first release of the component and it is still under development.
Therefore, it currently supports only the trigger functionality, which means
that you can use it to execute a certain event. In the case of this particular
component, you can get succeeded invoices.

Follow the Documentation link above to find what you need to do to set it up.

Like with all other {{site.data.tenant.name}} components that are under the
Apache license, you can clone it and enhance it yourself to include more
functionalities out of the box. Alternatively, you can contact our pre-sales team
if you prefer our developers to extend the Stripe integration connector for you.
